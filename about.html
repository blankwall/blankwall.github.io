            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a lead penetration tester and security researcher dedicated to hardening the systems that power our digital world. With over a decade of experience in the offensive security space, I provide a deep-dive perspective on systemic risk, specializing in the frontier of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.
            </p>
            <p>
                My methodology is rooted in a "tool-first" philosophy: I don’t just find vulnerabilities; I build automated frameworks and introspection tools to detect them at scale. My research into memory corruption and API security has been featured at global security summits including OffensiveCon Berlin, ShmooCon, and Sec-T Stockholm.

                <h3>GenAI & AI Security</h3>
                <p>
                    I specialize in the adversarial testing of complex, autonomous agentic workflows and provide deep-dive security assessments for large-scale AI infrastructure. This work includes securing stateful workflows in <strong>LangGraph</strong>, hardening <strong>RAG</strong> implementations, and auditing multi-agent architectures that utilize extensive, tool-heavy integrations via the <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>. I maintain a particular focus on the exploitation and mitigation of high-volume tool-calling systems and the unique security challenges inherent in modern AI orchestration layers.

                <h3>Research & Methodology</h3>
                <p>
                    While my foundation is built on low-level exploit development and RCE, my expertise encompasses the security of modern, large-scale web systems and distributed cloud infrastructure. I specialize in auditing massive API surfaces—identifying high-severity logic and authorization flaws—and engineering scalable security solutions for global-scale platforms.

            <div class="expertise-block">
                <h3>The Bridge</h3>
                <p>
                    This deep background in securing complex, high-traffic systems informs my recent research into GenAI. I bridge the gap between traditional web security and AI-specific threats, identifying novel attack vectors where web vulnerabilities and advanced prompt injection converge to compromise production AI agents.

            <div class="expertise-block">
                <h3>Scalable Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    I focus on the "Shift Left" of offensive security by designing and operationalizing scalable multi-agent security systems embedded directly into CI/CD pipelines. By integrating autonomous testing frameworks into large-scale cloud environments, I ensure that security is a continuous, automated component of the software development lifecycle.

                I am a U.S. Coast Guard veteran and a firm believer in the power of "adversary-driven" defense. This blog is a technical space where I document my latest tooling experiments, research into the emerging threats facing modern AI implementations, and the evolution of offensive security.
